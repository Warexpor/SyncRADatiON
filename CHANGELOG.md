# Changelog

## 0.4.2-dev — 2026-08-13

Protocol **v6** (incompatible with v5). Join dump is the live SProgress slot. UnityEvents and world FMOD replay on the client. Native puzzle solve methods on the solved edge.

### Added
- Full `SProgress.progress` list dump (bool/int/float/string/vector) + mid-presentation WorldId on join
- `EventZone.onInRange` / MultiCondition / BookScreen / `CutsceneCut.Proceed` presentation relay
- `StudioEventEmitter` Play/Stop by WorldId (skips Elster + radio UI); sliding-door one-shots
- Native `openDoor` / `delayedOpen` / `StartShutdown` / `CheckSolve` / `useRing` on solve
- `EXC_Elevator` flags only (never `startRide`); Kolibri + Adler snapshots

### Changed
- Version `0.4.2-dev`, protocol 6
- Harmony still per-class; one bad patch cannot abort the mod

## 0.4.1-dev — 2026-08-13

Protocol **v5** (incompatible with v4). Host-authoritative full-game pass: SceneFollow, interaction bus, story lockstep, shared storage, party keys, death policy.

### Added
- SceneFollow via `AsyncLoader` / `SceneHelper` / `LoadLevelZone` (client follows host chapter)
- Interaction request/ack for EventZone, UseItem, keypad, Dialoguer, cutscenes, EventScreen, storage, gunshot wake
- StoryCommit (`SProgress` + Dialoguer XML + `END_Manager`) and StoryPresentation native replay
- Shared `InventoryManager.boxItems` blob; party key ring for unique keys
- Puzzle types: tarot, mural, incinerator, scale, shrine, radio alignment, radio code lock
- Client downed vs host save-reload death

### Changed
- Version `0.4.1-dev`, protocol 5
- Enemy `playerPos` retarget every non-dead state; `END_Boss.Elster`; client AI puppeted at handshake
- Radio sync is `moduleInstalled` only (no tuner clobber)
- Off-chunk enemy pose snaps skipped when renderers are disabled (room isolation)

### Publish
- GitHub zip: `dist/SyncRADation-0.4.1-dev.zip` (dll + LiteNetLib + README). Nexus not in this release.

## 0.4.0-dev — 2026-08-13

Version reset: former `1.2.x-dev` is now **0.4.0-dev**. Protocol still **v4** (not a wire change).

### Changed
- Product version `0.4.0-dev` (honest pre-1.0 numbering)
- README / AGENTS.md aligned with current controls, WorldId authority table, and room-isolation rules

## 1.2.2-dev — 2026-08-03

### Changed
- **Entity spawner** moved **F7 → F11**
- **F7** opens **Location Teleporter** (chapter `lvl` jumps + in-level room `goto`/spawn). Removed native debug-console unlocker.
- **Location Teleporter:** Reeducation split into **normal** (`LOV_Reeducation`) and **corrupted** (`BIO_Reeducation`) entries.

## 1.2.2-dev — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **Remote weapon VFX:** shot pulse from equipped `magAmmo` decrease → `AnimTriggers.Fire` (full-auto safe; no longer stuck on held Fire1 edge)
- **Muzzle flash / case eject / smoke:** longer flash, source `MuzzleFlash`/`ReloadCaseEject` path match, no random PS fallback for cases
- **Aim laser:** world-space `LineRenderer`, material path-copy after IL2CPP Instantiate, real muzzle origin
- **Shell/action SFX:** delayed CombatSfx paths for pistol/revolver/rifle on remote shot (plus existing shotgun pump / flak eject)

### Changed
- Version `1.2.2-dev` (protocol still v4)

## 1.2.1-dev — 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **Room pull bug:** remote players no longer call `ConnectedDoors.StartA`/`StartB` when someone else uses a door. Room traverse is **local-only**; network only syncs **lock** state on `ConnectedDoors`.

## 1.2.0-dev — 2026-07-19

### Fixed (decompile-aligned)

- **Enemy damage** uses native `EnemyController.TakeDamage(fire, crit, hurt, noSneak)` on host; clients no longer DIY raycast + raw `hitbox.HP` math
- **Harmony** prefixes on both `TakeDamage` overloads → client hits report to host, host sim is authoritative
- **Puzzles** keyed by **WorldId** (FNV scene+hierarchy), not `FindObjectsOfType` index (cross-peer identity fix)
- **Doors** apply via `DoorNative` → private `openDoors`/`closeDoors`/`cycle` + `ConnectedDoors.StartA`/`StartB` when possible
- **World ItemPickup** host claim/grant: only claimer gets inventory; everyone else only hides; race-safe reservation

### Added

- Protocol **v4**: extended `EnemyDamage` (native chances), `WorldPickupClaim` / `WorldPickupGrant`, puzzles use `WorldId` in `PuzzleStateEntry`
- `Patches/EnemyTakeDamagePatches.cs`, `Patches/ItemPickupPatches.cs`, `Networking/DoorNative.cs`

### Changed

- Version `1.2.0-dev`, protocol 4 (incompatible with v3 clients)
- Removed multiplayer enemy DIY raycast from `ModRuntime` (FF raycast remains if enabled)

### Notes

- Connected room transitions still imperfect if both peers load different room chunks
- Cutscenes/Dialoguer still not co-op scripted
- Both installs must run this build

## 1.1.0-dev — 2026-07-19

### Added
- Protocol v3: SnapshotRequest, WorldPickupState, PlayerVital
- Join resync, world pickup hide, vitals, puzzles default on
